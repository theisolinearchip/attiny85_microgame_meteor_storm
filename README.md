A pretty raw single-button microarcade game (similar to the well-known _Flappy Bird_ and many others)
made in a bunch of hours to test some __attiny85__ + __SSD1306 OLED screen__ stuff.

(as a future __TODO__, the code can probably be improved, cleaned and/or expanded - maybe I'll continue this in the future, who knows...).

## Setup and install
Connect an __I2C__ SSD1306-based screen to the attiny85 __SDA__ and __SCL__ pins, add one button on __PB1__ and run _make_.

### How to play
Avoid hitting the screen borders and the big white squares (aka "meteors"). Hold the button to move up and release it to start falling
(some acceleration comes into play, here!). There's a non-persistent __high-score function__ + __current score display__ while playing.

## Additional libraries
### SSD1306 driver
I used the same driver I wrote for screen handling on my [Game of Life implementation on an attiny85](https://github.com/theisolinearchip/gameoflife_attiny85).
It's basically a set of command / data writing functions + some initial configurations and flash memory reading operations.

### I2C driver
I also wrote [the I2C driver](https://github.com/theisolinearchip/i2c_attiny85_twi) using the TWI interface for attiny85's micros
(the _wait times_ are tweaked a little bit for speed improvement - it seems to work fine with this specific screens).
